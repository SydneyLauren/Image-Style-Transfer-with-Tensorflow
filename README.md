### Style Transfer with Tensorflow

First and foremost, you should know that I did *not* write the code to perform the style transfer myself. I am implementing some terrific work found here https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf to use tensorflow to transfer photographs into they style of some artists that I enjoy.


Here I've transfered a picture of my dog, Samson, into the style of "Orchard in Bloom" by Zinaida Serebriakova.

<img src="styles/orchard-in-bloom-zinaida_serebriakova.jpg" height="190"/><img src="image_input/Samson2.jpg" height="190"/><img src="image_output/result_samson_orchard/result.png" height="190">

The next example was lot of fun. I decided to Bob Rossify Bob Ross.
<img src="styles/bob_ross4.jpg" height="190"/><img src="image_input/bobross_face.jpg" height="190"/><img src="image_output/result_bobross4/result.png" height="190">
